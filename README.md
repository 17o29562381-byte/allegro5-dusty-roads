-2-19-2026  Allegro5 was already ib my Linux install.  I don't know what I am doing just trying to get it to compile with the librarys what was DJGPP anyways!!???
  I guess it gets compiled with this:
  gcc code1.cpp -lallegro
  and run with *nothing* with ./a.out
  I guess look for allegro5 with the command 'aot search allegro5' and install it
